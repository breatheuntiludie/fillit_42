This is the smallest description i had ever done.

Changes of Margo (xlongfel) source files:
	1. Reworked Makefile
		1.1. Changed wildcards
		1.2. Added patsubst
		1.3. Reworked compiling with libft.a and all needed flags.
		1.4. Removed one extra .Phony
	2. There was splited function main.c on two functions: main.c and array.c
	3. Added ggeri's library and were deleted library functions in project
	4. Reworked fillit.h (and removed extra libft.h in fuctions)
	5. Reworked function "make2darray" in array.c
	6. Added '\n' in main.c

What we need:
	1. Check norminette
	2. May be optimize make2darray (norminette is crying)
	3. Delete all printf's and <stdio.h>
	4. Check recompiling in Makefeile
	5. Check incoming text, \n in the end

How to use it:
	Just run the whole program with command ./work (it will execute bash file)
